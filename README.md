This is a sphere rendered entirely using the pygame library and mathematics to create the matrices, I've added basic collision detection albeit not the most optimized and some basic physics to make it bounce

The gravity vector can be changed

The radius value can be changed to make it bigger or smaller

The borders of the walls can be changed but I found it best to leave it as is
